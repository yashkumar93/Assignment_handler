## Overview

Brutalist web landing page. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Web brutalism borrowed the name but not the playbook. Architectural brutalism was about honest materials — raw concrete, exposed utilities, structural legibility. Web brutalism took that last part and ran with it. The movement crystallized around 2014–2016, when Pascal Deville's brutalistwebsites.com began archiving sites that rejected the polished sameness of Bootstrap-era design. Suddenly there was a canon: Craigslist, the Drudge Report, early Bloomberg, academic homepages that hadn't been touched since 1997.

But here's the distinction that matters: web brutalism isn't just "ugly on purpose." It's a specific set of conventions. System fonts — Georgia, Times, Arial, or whatever the OS hands you. Default blue underlined links. Visible document structure where the HTML hierarchy *is* the design. No hero images. No smooth transitions. The page loads and it's done. You see the grid because there's nothing hiding it.

The web-specific version also carries an implicit argument: that the browser's defaults were already a design system. A good one. Every layer of CSS you add is a choice to obscure that, and maybe you should justify each one.

- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Visible grid structure, oversized typography, raw HTML aesthetic, thick harsh borders, no rounded corners, system fonts, deliberate misalignment, underlined links, monospace blocks, stark color blocks

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 420ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 80ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 0px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Sharp edges (0px) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.

- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No rounded corners — sharp edges only
- No subtle shadows — use hard borders instead
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos
